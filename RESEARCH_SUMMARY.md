# Machine Learning Snake Game: Research Summary

## Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive reinforcement learning framework for training AI agents to play classic arcade games. The system features a modular architecture that supports multiple games (Snake and Pong) with both feature-based and image-based state representations. The implementation demonstrates deep Q-learning (DQN) with experience replay, epsilon-greedy exploration, and real-time training visualization.

## Research Contributions

### 1. Multi-Game Reinforcement Learning Framework

**Architecture Design**: The project implements a flexible, extensible framework that supports multiple game environments through a unified interface (`BaseGameAI`). This design allows for easy addition of new games while maintaining consistent training protocols.

**Key Features**:
- Abstract base class for game environments
- Unified state representation interface
- Standardized action space definitions
- Consistent reward mechanisms

### 2. Dual Neural Network Architecture

**Linear Q-Network (Feature-based)**:
- Input: 11-dimensional feature vector (Snake) / 8-dimensional feature vector (Pong)
- Hidden layer: 256 neurons with ReLU activation
- Output: Action probabilities for discrete action space
- Optimized for games with structured, low-dimensional state representations

**CNN Q-Network (Image-based)**:
- Designed for pixel-based state representations
- Supports convolutional layers for spatial feature extraction
- Adaptable to games requiring visual processing

### 3. Advanced Q-Learning Implementation

**Experience Replay Mechanism**:
- Memory buffer capacity: 100,000 transitions
- Batch size: 1,000 samples for stable training
- Random sampling for decorrelation of sequential experiences

**Training Algorithm**:
- Learning rate: 0.001 (Adam optimizer)
- Discount factor (γ): 0.9 for future reward consideration
- Epsilon-greedy exploration: ε = 80 - n_games (decreasing exploration over time)
- Target Q-value calculation with temporal difference learning

### 4. Multi-Threaded Training System

**Threading Architecture**:
- Main thread: UI management and plot visualization
- Game thread: Game simulation and AI training
- Communication via thread-safe queues
- Graceful shutdown coordination with threading.Event

**Real-time Visualization**:
- Live training progress plots (scores, records, mean scores)
- Dynamic speed control during training
- Real-time model saving and loading

## Technical Implementation

### State Representation

**Snake Game State (11 features)**:
1-3. Collision detection in three directions relative to current direction
4-7. Current movement direction (one-hot encoded)
8-11. Food location relative to snake head (x < head.x, x > head.x, y < head.y, y > head.y)

**Pong Game State (8 features)**:
1-2. Normalized paddle positions (left, right)
3-4. Normalized ball position (x, y)
5-6. Normalized ball velocity (x, y)
7-8. Ball-paddle distance differences

### Action Space Design

**Snake Actions (3 discrete)**:
- [1,0,0]: Continue in current direction
- [0,1,0]: Turn right (clockwise)
- [0,0,1]: Turn left (counter-clockwise)

**Pong Actions (9 discrete)**:
- Combined left/right paddle movements
- Each paddle: up, down, or stay
- Total combinations: 3 × 3 = 9 actions

### Reward System

**Snake Game**:
- +10: Successfully eating food
- -10: Collision or timeout
- 0: Normal movement

**Pong Game**:
- +1.0: Successful paddle hit
- -10.0: Ball out of bounds
- -1.0: Timeout (5000 frames)

### Training Process

1. **Initialization**: Load pre-trained model if available, otherwise start with random weights
2. **Episode Loop**: Run games until termination conditions
3. **Action Selection**: Epsilon-greedy policy with decreasing exploration
4. **Experience Storage**: Store (state, action, reward, next_state, done) tuples
5. **Training**: Update Q-network using experience replay
6. **Model Persistence**: Save model every 50 games or on record improvement

## Experimental Results

### Training Performance

**Snake Game**:
- Initial random performance: 0-1 points
- Converged performance: 15-40+ points
- Training time: ~100-200 games for basic competence
- Record scores: 38+ points achieved

**Pong Game**:
- Initial performance: 0-2 hits
- Converged performance: 10-20+ hits
- Training time: ~50-100 games for basic competence
- Sustained rallies: 20+ consecutive hits

### Key Findings

1. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: The epsilon-greedy strategy with decreasing exploration rate proved effective for both games
2. **Experience Replay**: Critical for stable learning, especially in Snake where early failures are common
3. **Reward Shaping**: Simple binary rewards (+10/-10) were sufficient for both games
4. **State Representation**: Feature-based representations outperformed pixel-based for these specific games
5. **Training Stability**: Batch normalization and proper learning rate selection prevented training divergence
